# Final-DS_Capstone-Machine-Learning-Model-
Build a Machine Learning model for giving data sets.
There are some datasets are provided, collect the datas naalyze the problems based on datasets, then build a suitable ML model.
# Model Building approach
1. Analyze the problem (From problem statement)
2. Collect the data (from client or APIs..)
3. Analyze the data
4. Data preprocessing and cleaning (NULL or NAN values imputation, dropping columns, encodings, filling values etc.,)
5. Using EDA for insights of data (Using some powerful charts to get more details about data points)
6. Feature selecting in data for ML model (Selecting columns for X and y)
7. Splitting the data points to train and test
8. Fit the model
9. Train and Test the model
10. Evaluate the model

# ML models used in this project:
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. KNN
4. K-Means
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Fores
7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
